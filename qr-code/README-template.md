## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

While this was a relatively simple challenge, I did learn a few things. First, I learned where I can obtain styling information for elements in Figma.

### Continued development

There are two areas that I want to refine moving forward: Flexbox and positioning.

### Useful resources

- [A Complete Guide To Flexbox | CSS Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/#flexbox-properties) - I feel that this post does a very nice job of explaining Flexbox and what all of the properties do.
