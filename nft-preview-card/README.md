## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

For this challenge I had to learn how to create a semi-transparent overlay when a user hovers over an image.

### Continued development

Going forward I want to continue learning ways that I can use Flexbox to layout elements in more complex ways. I want to see if there are better ways to create overlays over elements.
